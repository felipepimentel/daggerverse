refactor(global): enhance version bumping and retrieval process

- Updated the BumpVersion method to utilize Dagger containers for version 
  management, improving isolation and reproducibility.
- Refactored GetCurrentVersion to also use Dagger containers, streamlining 
  the process of retrieving the latest version tag.
- Improved error handling and version parsing logic, ensuring robustness 
  in version management.
- Removed reliance on direct git command execution, enhancing compatibility 
  and maintainability.

These changes significantly improve the functionality and organization of 
the versioning module.
