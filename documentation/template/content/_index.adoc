This documentation follows the principles prescribed by the link:https://diataxis.fr[Diátaxis^] documentation system.

Diátaxis identifies four kinds of documentation based on two orthogonal dimensions which are:

* the objective which the user is seeking, whether it is acquiring skills or applying skills;
* the kind of information provided, whether it is action oriented or knowledge oriented.
